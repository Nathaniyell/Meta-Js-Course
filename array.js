//arrays are used to group a sequence of variables in a collection

var train1 = ["wheat", "barley", "patato", "salt", "rocks"];
console.log(train1[0]); //can be used to access the value with the index of 0

//arrays are objects because they have some built-in properties and methods e.g pop(),push()

var fruits =[]
fruits.push("apple")
fruits.push("banana")
console.log(fruits)
//The push() method adds a new item to the array while the pop() method removes the last item from an array
