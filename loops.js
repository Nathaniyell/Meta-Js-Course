/*Loops are used to continually execute repeated blocks of code until certain conditions are satisfied
Types of loops include: for, while and nested loops
Properties of this loops includes 1. a counter variable - 
var counter(i)= value
2. a condition - counter > 5
3. the counter must be incremented (increased or decreased depending on the need) - counter++ or counter--
for(var i = 0; i<5; i++){
    console.log(i)
}

The while loop is similar but the start counter is set outside the while loop and the incrementer is set inside the loop's body
var i = 0
while(i<5){
    console.log(i)
i++
}
