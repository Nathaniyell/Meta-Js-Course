//A data structure is a way to organize data. Examples of common javascript data structures include: objects, arrays, maps and sets
//An object is unaltered, noniterable collection of key value pairs and you use objects when you need to store and later access a value under a key

//An array which is an ordered iterable collection of values. Likewise, you use arrays when you need to store and later access a value under an index

const grades = [75, 95, 90, 85, 80, 85]
grades.map(grade=>grade)
